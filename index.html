      <p>
        An abyssinian cat's distinctive appearance, seeming long, lean and
        finely coloured compared to other cats, has been analogized to that of
        human fashion models. <br />Personality-wise, the cats traditionally
        display active, curious attitudes in which they frequently follow owners
        around and encourage play. Their dog-like characteristics also involve a
        particular sense of affection and desire for interaction.
        <br /><br />Abys have a distinctive wildcat look with their ticked coat
        and large erect ears. They are a highly social breed and can be
        demanding of attention.

      <h3>Thinking of getting a kitten?</h3>
      <p>
        If you're serious about getting a kitten, the abyssinian will be a great
        companion. <br />Especially if you're not just looking for a cat that
        will be a pretty addition to your household, but also your new best
        furry friend! <br />
